# NLP-Bootcamp-Final-Project
The main reason why we decided to do this project was to help people with mental health problems. As we know, 
social media can be kind of an open window to our lifes, but also our personal thoughts and opinions. Talking about
mental health problems such as depression, anxiety and even about having suicidal thoughts can be still tabu in our society 
and hard for some people to ask for help. 
We wanted to build a program to be used by professionals from the psychology field to find, and get in touch with people that may be in need of help
based on their posts on social media such as Twitter or Reddit.
